# Boot-To-Kiosk-In-Powershell with a pre defined website

This script enables automation of the Windows Assigned Access (Kiosk Mode) with Microsoft Edge and a pre defined website.

I never found any suitable solution for me, this is why I reverse engineered the Assigned Access creation. The result is this script.

## Note

As for now, this only workd for Windows 10. I will update the script in the future to support Windows 11

## Usage

This works out of the box, just change the 3 variables at the beginning of the script and you are good to go
